# Circuit-Simulator
This is my attempt at making a basic circuit simulator. The visuals are mundane and simple. I really dont graphic design, but the RIC Circuit Simulator Logic is all good. It is a simple project, something i want to revisit, but as of right now I can't be asked to re design UI and spend so much time adding new components.
