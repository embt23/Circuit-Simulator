# Circuit-Simulator
&emsp;This is my attempt at making a basic circuit simulator (This is my inspirations <https://www.falstad.com/circuit/>[link](www.falstad.com/circuit/)). This project is just an RIC circuit simulator. So far the components are just DC voltage sources, wires, resistors, inductors and capacitors. In the future I may add AC voltage sources, diodes, transistors (would require decent change to code), op-amps, voltmeters and ammeters. This would require a fair amount of alterations to UI. I do not enjoy graphic design. If I revisit this project I want to work with someone else who can control how it looks or maybe I will just enjoy making UI and visuals more. Next Thing that I would add would be the voltage and current visual aids as seen in the falstad program. I also want to maybe make a version that is made super barebones in C++ with ASCI Characters, or just see if i can make it just commands into a terminal instead of using mouse placement.  
&emsp;The first step of the program is creating the basic UI. The code is centered around the basic grid that can be dragged with left click and moved with mouse scroll. Five buttons for placing the different types of components and a button on the top right for live simulation. Black - wire; Green - voltage source; Red - resistor; Yellow - capacitor; Blue - inductor.

&emsp;When a component is placed, an instance of a class called **component** is created. This allows for each component to be defined as a subclass, and to hold its own set of variables (At this point I have not programmed the ability to customize the voltage, resistance, inductance and capacitance of each component; That would be the next thing to impliment). These instances are then put into an array called **components[]** The coordinates of each of the nodes is added to **storePointConnection**. The nodes that each component is connected to is then stored in **storeConnectionAtPoint**.
